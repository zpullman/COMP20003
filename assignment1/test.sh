# Simple Testing Script for Assignment 1
#
# Builds program and tests for two simple cases.
#
# How to use:
#	- Copy this file to the directory you're using to store your program.
#	- If this file, once copied, can't be run using test.sh, you may need
#		to run `chmod 777 test.sh` in your terminal window.
#	- Compile your program as usual.
#	- You can feel free to use this program for your own testing, we would 
#		however recommend you ensure your program still executes on the original
#		version of this file.
#	- You may like to explain what you think the output should be using the echo
#		command, so you know what to expect from your program.
#	- After saving your changes, you can run this script using test.sh.
#
# NOTE: This is in no sense a complete set of test cases, you'll need to write
#	some of your own to ensure your program is correct.
#
# NOTE2: This program will overwrite any file you have called exactly datafile,
#	datafile2, keyfile, keyfile2, outputfile1_1, outputfile1_2, outputfile2_1,
#	outputfile2_2 stdout1_1, stdout1_2, stdout2_1, stdout2_2, e_stdout1,
#	e_stdout2, e_outputfile1 or e_outputfile2.
